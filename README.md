2. Rat in a Maze

**Homework 2**
1. KMP
2. Strings calculation

**Homework 3**
1. Binary Tree

**Final Project - Adaptive Matrix Multiplication**    
  In this project you will implement and analyze, empirically and theoretically, a method for multiplying square matrices. The method will adapt to use algorithmic techniques depending on the system architecture on which it is run.
